ligand
(lig-und)
A molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site of another molecule.

ligand-gated ion channel receptor
A signal receptor protein in a cell membrane that can act as a channel for the passage of a specific ion across the membrane. When activated by a signal molecule, the receptor either allows or blocks passage of the ion, resulting in a change in ion concentration that usually affects cell functioning.

light-dependent reactions
The reactions of the first stage of photosynthesis, in which light energy is captured by chlorophyll molecules and converted to chemical energy stored in ATP and NADPH molecules.

light-independent reactions
The carbon-fixing reactions of the second stage of photosynthesis; energy stored in ATP and NADPH by the light-dependent reactions is used to reduce carbon from carbon dioxide to simple sugars; light is not required for these reactions.

light microscope (LM)
An optical instrument with lenses that refract (bend) visible light to magnify images of specimens.

light reactions
The steps in photosynthesis that occur on the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast and convert solar energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH, evolving oxygen in the process.

lignin
(lig-nin)
A hard material embedded in the cellulose matrix of vascular plant cell walls that functions as an important adaptation for support in terrestrial species.

limbic system
(lim-bik) [L. limbus, border]
A group of nuclei (clusters of nerve cell bodies) in the lower part of the mammalian forebrain that interact with the cerebral cortex in determining emotions; includes the hippocampus and the amygdala.

linkage
The tendency for certain alleles to be inherited together because they are located on the same chromosome.

linked genes
Genes that are located on the same chromosome.

linkage group
A pair of homologous chromosomes.

linkage map
A genetic map based on the frequencies of recombination between markers during crossing over of homologous chromosomes. The greater the frequency of recombination between two genetic markers, the farther apart they are assumed to be.

lipid
(lih-pid) [Gk. lipos, fat]
One of a family of compounds, including fats, phospholipids, and steroids, that are insoluble in water.

lipoprotein
[Gk. lipos, fat + proteios, primary]

(loh-kus) [L. place]
A particular place along the length of a certain chromosome where a given gene is located.

logistic population growth
A model describing population growth that levels off as population size approaches carrying capacity.

long-day plant
A plant that flowers, usually in late spring or early summer, only when the light period is longer than a critical length.

loop of Henle
(after F. G. J. Henle, German pathologist)
The long hairpin turn, with a descending and ascending limb, of the renal tubule in the vertebrate kidney; functions in water and salt reabsorption.
